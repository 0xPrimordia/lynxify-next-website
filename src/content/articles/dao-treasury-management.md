# Treasury Management for the LYNX DAO

A well-managed treasury is the backbone of any successful DAO. For the LYNX DAO, we're implementing a multi-faceted approach to treasury management that balances security, liquidity, and growth potential.

## Treasury Structure

Our treasury will be divided into three main allocations:

### 1. Operating Reserve (40%)

This portion of the treasury is allocated to short-term operational needs:

- Development costs
- Marketing initiatives
- Community incentives
- Bug bounties

These funds will be held primarily in stablecoins to ensure liquidity and value stability.

### 2. Strategic Reserve (40%)

The strategic reserve is designed for medium to long-term initiatives:

- Protocol investments
- Strategic partnerships
- Liquidity provision
- Market making

This portion will be diversified across major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) and yield-generating opportunities.

### 3. Endowment Fund (20%)

The endowment is our long-term sustainability mechanism:

- Ultra-long-term horizon (5+ years)
- Conservative investment strategy
- Focus on capital preservation
- Generates sustainable yield

## Governance Oversight

All treasury movements above 50,000 USDC equivalent will require a governance vote. Below this threshold, a multi-sig committee of 5 members (3 core team, 2 community-elected) can authorize expenditures.

## Transparency Measures

We're implementing the following transparency measures:

- Monthly treasury reports
- Real-time dashboard showing all treasury holdings
- Transaction logs with explanations for all movements
- Quarterly financial reviews

## Next Steps

We're currently setting up the multi-sig wallets and developing the treasury dashboard. We expect to have the full treasury management system in place by the end of Q1 2024.
